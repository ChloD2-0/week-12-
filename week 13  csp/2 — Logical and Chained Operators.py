# Objective:
# Students will use logical (and, or, not) and chained comparison operators in Python to build compound conditions.

# Key Notes:

# and → Both conditions must be True

# or → At least one condition must be True

# not → Inverts True/False

# You can chain comparisons: 1 < x < 5

# Examples:
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 15)   # True
print(x < 5 or x == 10)   # True
print(not(x == 10))       # False
print(1 < x < 20)         # True

# score calculator 
score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))
# # if score is between 90 and 100
# # assign grade A
# if 90 <= score <= 100:
#     print("Grade: A")

# # if score is between 80 and 89
# # assign grade B
# elif 80 <= score < 90:
#     print("Grade: B")

# # if score is between 70 and 79
# # assign grade C
# elif 70 <= score < 80:
#     print("Grade: C") 

# # if score is between 60 and 69
# # assign grade D
# elif 60 <= score < 70:
#     print("Grade: D")

# # if score is below 60 
# # assign grade F
# else:
#     print("Grade: F")

if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    print("Grade: C")
if score >= 60 and score < 70:
    print("Grade: D")
elif score < 60:
    print("Grade: F")  


# Practice Problems:

# Write an expression that checks if a number is between 50 and 100 (inclusive).
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if  50 <= number <= 100:
    print(f"The number {number} is between 50 and 100")
else:
    print(f"The number {number} is not between 50 and 100")
# Write an expression that checks if a number is NOT equal to 0 and greater than 10.
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(x != 0 and x > 10) 
# Use chained comparison to check if 3 < 4 < 5.
print(3 < 4 < 5)
